# Quantum Geometry Learning Systems (QGLS)

**Quantum Geometry Learning Systems (QGLS)** is a novel AI architecture that brings the principles of quantum mechanics into classical deep learning models through topological and entanglement-inspired design. Developed by **Moonshot Labs**, QGLS is fully open-source and released under the **MIT License**.

---

## 🌌 Overview
QGLS models intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of **geometry, resonance, and entanglement**, using knot-based structures, interference patterns, and wave-driven propagation. This architecture is a step toward topological intelligence systems shaped by the physics of quantum behavior—without the need for quantum hardware.

## 🔬 Key Features
- **Entangled Connection Layer:** Simulates interference using entanglement coefficients (ε), resonance phases (ϕ), and knot tension (τ).
- **Topological Network Structure:** Nodes are organized in trefoil or figure-eight knots to shape signal flow.
- **Wave-Based Propagation:** Information moves non-linearly across entangled paths.
- **Collapse Resolution Layer:** Resolves signal superposition using entropy, energy, or tension-based collapse mechanisms.
- **Resonance Loss Function:** Penalizes disharmonic phase interference to encourage coherent learning.
- **Dataset Adapter:** Maps classical input data onto the knot structure.
